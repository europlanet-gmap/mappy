# Mappy plugin

This QGIS plugin collects several useful algorithms to easily generate geological 
maps starting from contacts and points.

The core idea behind this plugin is described at 

This plugin is developed as the result of the PLANMAP project (N 776276) and is now maintained thanks to the
EUROPLANET-GMAP infrastructure (N 871149) and the JANUS mission. 

The algorithms are provided in the form of ```processing``` tools (look for mappy in the qgis toolbox).
