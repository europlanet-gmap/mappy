# Mappy plugin

This QGIS plugin collects several useful algorithms to easily generate geological 
maps starting from contacts and points.

More info and documetation can be found an [this GitHub page](https://github.com/europlanet-gmap/mappy).

> This plugin was developed as the result of the PLANMAP project (N 776276) and is now maintained thanks to the
> EUROPLANET-GMAP infrastructure (N 871149) and supported by the JANUS camera team of the JUICE mission (ASI-INAF 2018-25-HH.0). 

The algorithms are provided in the form of ```processing``` tools (look for mappy in the qgis toolbox).
